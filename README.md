# E-Wallet-System-Design

## Description
This is a Wallet System API, that assigns a wallet to users when they 
register an account.
The project is built with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

I'm still working on the card funding feature for funding the wallet.

## Installation 
clone the repo and npm install makes the necessary dependencies available to you

## Features
The user can perform the following functions:
- the user can register an account and get a wallet assigned to them.
- the user can fund the wallet with a bank transfer or debit card.
- the user can send money to another user in the system with just an email.
- the user can withdraw money from the wallet.
